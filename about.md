**Oat Bot** is a super-cute robot super-computer designed to make perfect websites, commerce solutions and custom software through digital telepathic client communication. **Oat Bot** can run for an entire day on one single oat! All oats are 100% vegan. Raw & gluten-free oat option available.

In the real world, my name is **Dino** and I'm a software engineer from London that makes websites and web apps for my wonderful clients.

My expertise lies in Ruby development, but I also work with Elixir, have experience with design and front-end, and am currently studying SQL and Linux.

I'm employed full-time in the UK as a developer by [CollectPlus](https://www.collectplus.co.uk), and therefore not available to take on new projects.

I work with brands, start-ups businesses and individuals to bring web ideas to fruition. You can view some of my work [here](/projects).

I want to hear from you.
