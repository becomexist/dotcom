In the real world, my name is **Dino** and I'm a software engineer from London that makes websites and web apps for my wonderful clients.

I'm currenty employed full-time in the UK as a developer by [CollectPlus](https://www.collectplus.co.uk), and therefore not available to take on new projects.

I work with brands, start-ups businesses and individuals to bring web ideas to fruition. You can view some of my work [here](/projects).

I want to hear from you.
